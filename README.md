Project Title

Smart Study Planner

Summary

Smart Study Planner is an AI-based tool that helps students plan their study time more effectively. It analyzes subjects, deadlines, and available time to suggest a balanced and personalized study schedule that reduces stress and improves learning outcomes.

Background

Many students struggle with time management, especially when juggling multiple subjects, homework, and exams. Procrastination and poor planning are very common problems in schools.

This project aims to help with:

Poor time management among students

Stress caused by last-minute studying

Uneven study habits (focusing too much on one subject)

My personal motivation is that studying can feel overwhelming, and a simple AI assistant could help students stay organized and confident. This topic is important because good study habits support both mental well-being and academic success.

How is it used?

The user enters their subjects, upcoming deadlines, difficulty level of each subject, and how many hours per day they can study. The AI then creates a suggested study plan that spreads the workload evenly over time.

The solution is mainly used:

At home or after school

During exam periods or busy school weeks

The users are students, especially teenagers, so the design should be simple, clear, and stress-free.

Example code idea:

def create_study_plan(subjects, hours):
    plan = {}
    for subject in subjects:
        plan[subject] = hours / len(subjects)
    return plan

Data sources and AI methods

The project mainly uses user-provided data, such as:

Subjects

Deadlines

Available study hours

AI methods could include:

Rule-based logic for simple versions

Machine learning for predicting optimal study time in advanced versions

External data sources could later include:

School calendars

Learning platforms APIs (optional)

Example table:

Component	Description
Input	Subjects, deadlines, hours
Output	Personalized study plan
Method	Simple AI logic / ML
Challenges

This project does not:

Guarantee better grades

Replace good teaching or motivation

Limitations and ethical considerations:

The plan may not fit everyone perfectly

User data must be handled carefully and privately

The AI should not pressure students into unhealthy study routines

What next?

In the future, this project could grow by:

Adding reminders and notifications

Tracking study progress over time

Integrating with school apps or calendars

To move forward, I would need:

More programming skills

Knowledge of machine learning

Feedback from real student users
